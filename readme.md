# Electron Better Web Request

This module aims to extends the usage of `electron-web-request` by allowing to bind different listeners to the lifecycle events proposed by Electron. It aligns with the base usage found [here](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-request), but work around [this issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10478) by proposing a multi-listeners mecanism.

It can be used as a drop in replacement, and only needs to receive the `electron-web-request` as an injected dependency to work indenticaly. If used as is, it will only use the last registered listener for a method (retro-compatible). On top of that, the [API]() offers ways to add / remove listeners, give them context and define a custom merging strategy for all applicable listeners.

## Getting started

### Install

```bash
npm install electron-better-web-request
```

### Usage

Override Electron web request
```js
enhanceWebRequest(session);
```
Calling `enhanceWebRequest()` with the target `session` will override its `webRequest` with this module. From there, you can keep using it as usual, with all the new benefits.

*âš  Note :* If you call `enchanceWebRequest` on a session that has already been enhanced, it will NOT override again the module, preserving all the listeners that you previously registered.

Basic drop in replacement
```js
const filter = {
  urls: ['https://*.github.com/*', '*://electron.github.io']
}

session.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders(filter, (details, callback) => {
  details.requestHeaders['User-Agent'] = 'MyAgent'
  callback({cancel: false, requestHeaders: details.requestHeaders})
})
```

With merging strategy
```js
const filter = {
  urls: ['https://*.github.com/*', '*://electron.github.io']
}

// Add more than one listener...
session.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders(filter, (details, callback) => {
  details.requestHeaders['User-Agent'] = 'MyAgent'
  callback({cancel: false, requestHeaders: details.requestHeaders})
})

session.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders(filter, (details, callback) => {
  // Alter the web request in another way
  callback({cancel: false, [...]})
})

[...]

// ... then define a resolver with your own strategy
default.webRequest.setResolver('onBeforeSendHeaders', (listeners) => {
  // "listeners" is an array of objects representing matching listeners for the current web request
  // Use context and results to decide what to execute and how to merge
  // Return your final result
  
  // Example : Default resolver implementation
  // -> modify the web request only with the last registered listener
  const sorted = listeners.sort((a, b) => b.context.order - a.context.order);
  const last = sorted[0];
  return last.apply();
})
```
Check the API details below to see what the array [`listeners` is made of]().

## API

### Event methods

All the original web request methods are available :

With callback : `onBeforeRequest` `onBeforeSendHeaders` `onHeadersReceived`  
Without callback : `onSendHeaders` `onResponseStarted` `onBeforeRedirect` `onCompleted` `onErrorOccurred`

The all use the same original signature, plus an additional (and optional) set of options :

**`onBeforeRequest([filters ,] listener, [options])`**

- `filters` *Object* (optional)
  - `urls` *string[]* : Array of URL patterns that will be used to filter out the requests that do not match the URL patterns.

  If the `filter` is omitted then all requests will be matched.

- `listener` *Function*  
  This function will be called with `listener(details, [callback])` when the API's event has happened :
  - `details` object describes the request
  - `listener` is passed with a `callback` (for certain events only, cf with/without callback), which should be called with a `response` object when listener has done its work.

- `options` *Object* (optional)  
  This object can hold any options you wish to be associated with your `listener`. They will be tied to its context and can be used later on in your resolver strategy (cf `setResolver()` below).

For more details about `filters` or `listener` please refer to [Electron Web Request documentation](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-request).

### Additionnal methods

To extend the behavior of web requests listeners, the module adds the following methods :

**`addListener(method, filter, listener, context)`**
- `method` *string*  
  The name of the targeted method (onBeforeRequest, onCompleted, etc.)  

- `filter` *Object*  
  - `urls` *string[]* : Array of URL patterns that will be used to filter out the requests that do not match the URL patterns. Same structure as the original filters.

- `listener` *Function*  
  Action

- `context` *Object*  
  Options

Do blabla  
Returns a listener, such as `{}`

**`removeListener(method, id)`**  
- `method` *string*  
  Idem

- `id` *string*  
  Id of a listener, generated when added.

Remove listener from a method, and its filters.

**`clearListeners(method)`**  
- `method` *string*
  Idem

Remove ALL listeners to a method, clear filters and unsubscribe.

**`setResolver(method, resolver)`**
- `method` *string*  
  Idem

- `resolver` *Function*  
  A function with the sigature like `resolver(listeners) => {}`. Used to blabla, do blabla.

Assign to, and used to do something awesome.

**`hasCallback(method)`**  
- `methid` *string*  
  Idem

Used to know if a method has a callback or not.

**`getListeners()`**  

Used to get all the registered filters by methods.

**`getListenersFor(method)`**  
- `method` *string*  
  Idem

Used to get all the listeners registered to a specif method.

**`getFilters()`**  

Used to get all the filters applied to a method.

**`getFiltersFor(method)`**  
- `method` *string*  
  Idem

Used to get all the filters applied to a specif method.
